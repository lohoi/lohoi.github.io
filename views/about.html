        I'm a senior dual majoring in Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor
        with plans to graduate by May of 2018. My interests include computer security, machine learning, and web development. 
        Outside of class, you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, table tennis, or tennis.
